Project Euler Solutions 
=======================

These are my solutions to some of the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) problems.
The language used for this project is Python, which offered some advatanges.
It would be a fun and interesting exercise to repeat the challenges in different languages.


Most of the problems have basic assertions set up as unit tests.

Common functionality has been refactored to the `euler.lib` package.


I strongly suggest solving the problems by yourself before looking at the code.


Use `runner.py` to run the problems.

Usage:
 * `./runner.py` Run all problems
 * `./runner.py -t` Run tests on all problems
 * `./runner.py -n 17` Run problem 17
 * `./runner.py -n 17 -t` Run tests on problem 17
 * `./runner.py -h` Show usage help
